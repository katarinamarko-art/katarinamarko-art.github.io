        <p>
          Remains is an interactive installation that explores the relationship between material remnants of
          the past and the contemporary digital world. The work addresses language as one of humanity's
          most significant achievements, questioning its emergence, transformation, and potential
          disappearance.
          The viewer enters an isolated hybrid space and assumes an active role in
          directing the process. By reorganizing bricks according to an architectural plan, the participant's actions are tracked by
          a camera and translated into a digital linguistic message. The viewer thus becomes both
          constructor tand destroyer, witnessing how material actions generate immaterial meaning. The
          work reveals language as a shared foundation of civilization, shaped through the ongoing
          interaction between physical remnants and digital traces.

        <h2>HILO ROJO</h2>
        <p>
          Hilo Rojo is an installation that examines the relationship between primitive belief systems and
          contemporary modes of understanding the world. In modern societies, reality is largely structured
          through rational , systematic frameworks, often marginalizing the surreal, the spiritual, and the
          transcendent. This project investigates the possibility of reintroducing these dimensions within a
          contemporary context.
          Central to the work is the motif of the red thread, functioning as both a marker of difference and a
          point of connection. It symbolizes a latent continuity between past and present forms of human
          experience, suggesting an enduring need for symbolic and ritualistic structures. Through this
          element, the installation questions the limits of rationalization and proposes the relevance of the
          irrational and the spiritual in shaping contemporary perceptions of reality.

        <p>
          The installation View from Above explores individual emotions within a collective experience. The
          audio-visual environment is shaped by unconscious patterns of behavior and movement,
          establishing a relationship between the conditioning of the collective and the position of the
          individual within it.
