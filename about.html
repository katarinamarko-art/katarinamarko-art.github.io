      <strong>About</strong>
      <p>
      Katarina Stević &amp; Marko Dokić are visual artists based in Novi Sad, Serbia, working
      collaboratively as an artistic duo. Emerging from a shared background in painting, their practice
      has evolved into conceptual, installation-based and audio-visual forms, with a strong focus on
      immersive and participatory environments.

      Their work examines the persistence and transformation of historical narratives, belief systems,
      and symbolic languages within contemporary contexts. Through research-driven processes, they
      investigate the relationship between primal and rationalized structures, individual and collective
      identity, and the shifting boundaries between material and immaterial forms of knowledge.
      Language, ritual, and inherited codes function as recurring points of inquiry, approached as
      dynamic systems shaped by social, spatial, and technological conditions.

      Their collaborative methodology is grounded in dialogue and shared research, allowing
      conceptual frameworks to determine both medium and form. Drawing on philosophy, literature,
      and social theory, they develop site-responsive works that invite active engagement and critical
      reflection. Alongside studio-based practice, they engage with community-oriented and socially
      situated projects as an integral extension of their work.
